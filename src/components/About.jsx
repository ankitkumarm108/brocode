       Hi, I’m Ankit Kumar, a Team Lead – Mobile Application Development, specializing in React Native for Android & iOS apps.
With 3+ years focused on React Native, I combine deep technical expertise with strong leadership skills.

I love building clean, functional, and creative mobile applications that deliver seamless user experiences across platforms. As a team lead, I guide developers, ensure best practices, and drive projects from concept to successful deployment.

My core skills include React Native, JavaScript, TypeScript, state management (Redux, Context API), API integration, performance optimization, and app store deployment. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through mobile technology and mentoring teams to deliver their best work.

When I’m not coding, I stay curious about the latest tools, trends, and practices in the mobile ecosystem, always eager to learn and grow.
